On Slashdot, one of the best known forums for geeks, you can read [a longer discussion on Adobe's plans to make their creative suite subscription only](http://slashdot.org/story/13/05/06/1858228/adobe-creative-suite-going-subscription-only).

There are some interesting comments (thanks to the user called khopesh for spreading useful information on free softwarre), many that are barely worth been read... some just bitching about Adobe and other big Software companies, some discussion the free software alternatives.

As usual, the free software alterantives does not seem to be taken too serious. But I'm getting use to it...

What I'm a bit less used to: Scribus does not get mentioned a single time in the whole thread (at least not at the time I've been skimming through it).

Is everybody else wrong or the time has come for the Scribus community to draw some conclusions?

- The Scribus development model should change or...
- The goals of the Scribus project should change.

Personally, I don't want to sit and watch how the project sinks into oblivion...
