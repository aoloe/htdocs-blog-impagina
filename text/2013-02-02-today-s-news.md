When I think of writers, my first thoughts don't go to those brave authors, who are spending the best years of their life cranking out that 600 pages novel nobody will ever voluntarily read... eh em...  If a book must be, I mostly think of technical books.

But I confess it: my main focus is rather on all those dedicated people, who are working hard to spread news and information about topics, people or areas they care of. The question being: how they can best reach their target and what tools they need and want.

In this regard, Joshua Gans' [Information Wants to be Shared](http://joshuagans.com/information-wants-to-be-shared/), was a very interesting read. In the "Sharing the News" chapter, I've found a few interesting statements:

> Facebook is currently the largest news organization in the world. Facebook provided a platform whereby individuals became reporters, editors, and publishers.

> [...]

> Twitter has become a platform for finding out what just happened.

> [...]

> The iPad has spawned algorithmic solutions that present very newspaper-like.

Ah ah!

Will the future be on paper? Will the future need fancy typography? Color management and [Schmucks](http://blog.mmiworks.net/2009/05/gimp-enter.html)? And what about being able to import [2 bits CGM images](http://lists.scribus.net/pipermail/scribus-commit/2013-January/005598.html)?

Somehow those features don't really seem to matter that much if you're rather focused on spreading knowledge... But just using Facebook and Twitter also sounds to me a bit cheap...

For sure, when traveling around town, despite seeing a growing number of people staring at their phones and pads – and not all of them are playing Angry Birds –, I have the feeling that most of the readers are still preferring the daily newspaper or a thick book. So, beside asking myself if the digital consume is adding up or replacing the paper staples, when working on the [future tools](http://libregraphicsmeeting.org/2013/) it is important to know, if one can afford to setup a workflow that ignores the specific needs related to the printing on paper. The other way round – that is, setting up a workflow that is not optimized for digital distribution – is definitively a no-go.

I for one, I'm using google+ and my blog to spread my – oh so interesting – thoughts on the future of publishing... But, at the end, if somebody can convince me that those papers are worth it, I may want to collect all my writings into a more organic form. What are the tools that I will want to be using?
