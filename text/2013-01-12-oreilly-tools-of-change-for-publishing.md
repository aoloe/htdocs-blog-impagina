Today @JeffMcNeil made me aware of [O'Reilly's "Tools of Change for Publishing" Conference](http://www.toccon.com/toc2013/).

Now, i would like to now why, nobody asked us – the scribus guys – if we would like to be part of it? I AM THE AUTHOR TO THE SOON TO BE PUBLISHED EPUB PLUGIN FOR SCRIBUS. DO I NOT QUALIFY FOR IT?

Seriously, I doubt that would really fit there, I live on the other side of the sea, and 1'500 dollars are lot of money for me! No hard feelings. Really.

Even more seriously, – and I'm really serious here – I fear that O'Reilly is indirectly telling us, that we're doing something the wrong way...

- Are we producing the wrong software?
- Are we caring about the wrong features in our software?
- Are we targetting the wrong people?

You've guessed it: those are the questions I want to go after in this blog in the next few months...

So, even if we won't be at O'Reilly's TOC Conference, I will go through the scheduled talks, pick the ones that I most would have liked to attend and write a couple of lines about each of them.

### [Get Better at Git: Applying Version Control to Publishing](http://www.toccon.com/toc2013/public/schedule/detail/26977); Tim Berglund (GitHub, Inc.), Matthew McCullough (GitHub, Inc.)

At this specific point, probably one of the two topics that are most interesting for me: how to use standard tools for collaboration on rich documents [1]. This same blog post is written (and if you're not reading this on google+ also published) through GitHub. But as far as I know, Markdown is all I can use for rich text formatting. Embedding HTML – despite being the correct way to add more complex formatting in a Markdown document – would already make it hard to merge, at least for people who like to state "Hey, I'm no coder".

The real challenges start when you want to take into account the typographic quality of your document. How do you merge the corrections from a proof reader with the typographical fine tuning from the layouter?

Lean Publishing: The Future of Publishing, for Authors and Publishers
Peter Armstrong (Leanpub)

Lean Publishing is the act of publishing an in-progress ebook using lightweight tools and many iterations to get reader feedback, pivot until you have the right book and build traction once you do. This talk does a deep dive into each of the elements of that definition, understanding the origin and meaning of all its parts. This includes open source software, Lean Startup theory, customer development, blogs and more. It also includes a discussion of the historical origin of Lean Publishing, in both early storytelling and in serial fiction. The talk also covers the evolution of the Lean Publishing ideas from their first iteration focused primarily on authors to their current 2.0 version focused on authors and publishers.

If you’re interested in the future of publishing, and in new approaches and opportunities that ebooks can empower publishers to take, this talk may be of interest to you.

Leanpub
Peter Armstrong is the co-founder of Leanpub, and the author of Lean Publishing, Hello! Flex 4 and Flexible Rails. Peter coined the term Lean Publishing, has written a manifesto about it, and is writing an in-progress ebook about it. Leanpub was founded based on the principles in this manifesto.

Book as API
Hugh McGuire (PressBooks / LibriVox / Iambik ), Alistair Croll (Solve For Interesting)

While we have gone from print to ebook, there is still much potential of digital that ebooks don’t allow, because they are not truly connected to the web. We’ve seen on the web the power of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) which allow services to be built on top of existing platforms. Think of the multitude of apps that interact with Facebook, of the tools that use Google Maps. Why don’t we have an API for digital books yet? And what will it look like?

This is probably the most exciting question to come out of “Book: A Futurist’s Manifesto—Essays from the bleeding edge of publishing.”


Designing And Creating A Social Book App Using Open-source Technologies
Haig Armen (Emily Carr University of Art + Design)
2:30pm Wednesday, 02/13/2013

Canadian designer, Haig Armen will share the strategy, design and technology used to create a new approach to a digital book – a social book.
http://www.ecuad.ca/

Why not use open source content managment systems to provide a social layer, with comment moderation, contributor registration and even content syncing? See how a simple Wordpress CMS can drive a distributed social reading experience through a PhoneGap-based multi-platform social app which features a unique gestural interface with dynamically-updated content.

Participants will learn:
How to think about digital books as a micro-community using a distributed cloud-based content model
How to balance social functionality within a digital book and how to design gesturals interfaces to imply metaphorical meaning
See how to combine open source tools to build an affordable social book mobile application.


The Open Book

2:30pm Wednesday, 02/13/2013
Laura Dawson (Bowker)
Hugh McGuire, in Book: A Futurist’s Manifesto, posits that the book and the internet will merge. Ebooks are just one step away from being web pages. Eventually they will be web pages. And publishers will need to treat them as web pages.

When books are open, accessible, interoperable – when they can talk with one another in the same fashion web pages can talk to one another – how do publishers publish? How do readers find?

In this keynote, I would like to introduce concepts of the semantic web to the larger book industry. Resource Description Framework (or microdata, or microformat) ontologies can be helpful in creating schemas for search engines that will enable readers to find not only the book they are looking for, but the most appropriate passages within that book. Linking to passages within other books is also, of course, an eventuality (just as websites link to web pages on other websites). In such an environment, one book opens the door to many other books. In this way, a single book can actually contain multitudes of other books.

This will be a very high-level presentation – my goal is to get the book industry thinking about the direction publishing is headed in, and show some of the exciting possibilities that lie ahead when books can actually communicate with one another.

Reading Books On Pixels And Paper
Moderated by:
Max Fenton (maxfenton.com)
Panelists:
Allen Tan (New York Times), Mandy Brown (A Book Apart)

With our canons on our phones, our highlights in the clouds, libraries that deliver to local branches, and every treasure just one-click and two-day shipping away— how are we making the most of these luxuries? What are the best features of books—on screen and on paper—and why does this moment feel so exciting as readers?

Debate: eBooks vs. Web Apps For Interactive Content
Bill McCoy (International Digital Publishing Forum (IDPF)), Sanders Kleinfeld (O'Reilly Media, Inc.)
Should publishers develop and deliver highly interactive digital experiences as eBooks or as apps coded by Web developers? When is your digital content a “book”, and when is it an “app”, and is there a meaningful distinction to be made between the two anymore? Is the difference between “born digital” content and “enhanced” titles a matter of degree or a fundamental dichotomy? As E Ink-based dedicated eReaders give way to much more capable tablets and smartphones, what are the opportunities and risks in leveraging the new capabilities to deliver more engaging experiences to readers? Sanders Kleinfeld, author and Publishing Technology Engineer at O’Reilly Media, and Bill McCoy, Executive Director of the IDPF, the organization that develops EPUB, will discuss the issues and debate the pros and cons of app vs. eBook approaches. The focus will be on practical guidance for publishers on the teams, tools and workflows they should be putting in place now.

[1] The other one being: how to get publishing tools to play nice – really nice! – together.

[2] Do footnotes really work?
