title:Tools of Change vs. Future Tools
---
In the follow up to one of my recent posts, [@JeffMcNeil](https://plus.google.com/103683161748775017955/) made me aware of [O'Reilly's "Tools of Change for Publishing" Conference](http://www.toccon.com/toc2013/).

I've skimmed through the program and there are some amazing conferences! During the next few days, I will write down some thoughts about the ones that most caught my interest.

All in all, one thing strikes me most: rather than a discussion on the "Tools of Change", it looks like we are preparing us for an epochal revolution! There's no place for the paper anymore. And, on top of it, I don't see traces either of all the technical skills that once made the difference in the publishing world.

What will be the paper good for in the future? I hope that it won't be only used for filling my – physical – letter box with Junk Mail...

There is a second thing that bothers me: why nobody asked us – the Scribus guys – if we would like to be part of it? Being the author of the soon to be published Epub plugin for Scribus, don't I qualify to be there?

I'm only half serious here. I probably don't really fit there, I live on the other side of the Atlantic, and the 1'500 dollars for the entry ticket are lot of money for me. Well, there is indeed half serious part in my remark: it relates to the question whether Scribus qualifies as a tool that will be part of this change.

There are three main questions that I keep asking myself:

- Are we producing the right software?
- Are we caring about the right features in our software?
- Are we targeting the right people?

Finding the answers to those questions may get us an invitation for [TOC 2014](http://www.toccon.com)...

But we won't just let a full year go by, waiting for it to happen and we will be certainly have some wonderful discussion at the [Libre Graphics Meeting 2013](http://libregraphicsmeeting.org/2013). It's at the beginning of April in Madrid and our device is "[Future Tools](http://libregraphicsmeeting.org/2013/about/)"! Just a coincidence?

And Jeff already started to [summarize his thoughts](http://parliamentpress.com/future-publishing-tools/): it's time for to go and read it carefully!
