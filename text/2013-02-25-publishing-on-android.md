During the past weekend, I've made my first steps in Android programming. It was fun!

One question sticks: what would it be like, to do publishing work (yes, I'm talking about publishing content by using an android tablet, not about publishing apps on the Google Market!) thorugh a Tablet or a Phone?

If I think of using Scribus on a Tablet, well, not the best dreams...

But can't we think about it the other way round? What would it be like to prepare publications on a tablet? Who could have a use for it? What could be the targetted output?
