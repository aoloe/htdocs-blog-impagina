When you're a geek, Latex seems to be a good option for self-publishing your book... most of all if it's about programming!

- Are Latex files apted to be shared? Check.
- Are Latex files compatible with revion systems? Check.
- Are there WYSIWYG – or at lest "friendly" – editing frontends to Latex? ... well, it depends...
- Would it possible to create a nice, powerful, friend, and general purpose frontend to Latex? Good question...
