One of the characteristics of Scribus is that we have a [Bug Tracking System](http://bugs.scribus.net). This is the place where the users are invited to post their sorrows with Scribus.

But it's also the place for submitting the requests for new features. The result is a long list with 1139 new issues, 352 aknowledged, 156 confirmed and 370 assigned ones.
