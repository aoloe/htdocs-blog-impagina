- creating a js opengl based game engine
- created in a "few night" by a "few guys"... and it already has a hacking community

Yes, I'm a a bit – very – jalous of the communities that pop up around games and games engines. But let's use it in a constructive way: how can we biuld lively communities around graphics software?

But, seeing that it's possible to create a game engine running in the browser, I guess that a 2D drawing engine for layouting and vector drawing should not be impossible to create.
