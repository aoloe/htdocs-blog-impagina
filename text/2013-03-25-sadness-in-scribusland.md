This is an excert from the Scribus IRC channel

    <XXX> There is sadness in scribus-land
    <SCR> hi JonCruz
    <XXX> I know of two major attempts to use Scribus that had issues
    <XXX> One was an attempt at a magazine that ended up falling back to InDesign
    <SCR> JonCruz: what kind of issue?
    <XXX> usability, etc.
    <XXX> Then there were the issues Scislac had with doing stuff for Scale
    <SCR> well, the UI is very different from ID, that's for sure
    <XXX> and getting things to function correctly at the printers
    <SCR> that's all quite general. we'd need to know more

Are those
