One of the questions I'm asking myself is: what is a classical DTP program – a program like Scribus is – good for?

Two warnings:

- I don't mean what it can be used for, but what it is really made for! Those use cases for which there are no better substitutes
- I tend to value more, examples that take into account the curent trends in the publishing world.

So, what are those ues cases?

- Still none. But I'm not finished with building this list. In any case your feedback (on the Mailing list, as Ticket here on github or per private mail is welcome!)

Here are some usecases, where I'm still in doubt if a DTP program is best suited:

- Newsletter / Newspaper printed with Spot colors on offset presses. Currently, you still see some of them laying around, but I wonder how fast it's going to be replaced by digital versions.


Having seen the "real" use cases for Scribus, I'd like to list the ones that I didn't judge as best fits:

- Packaging: a vector graphics program is probably better suited
- Full color newsletter / small newspaper: the main target will probably be the net and they will probably be printed on Laser printers or on full colors. The extended color management from a DTP program may not that imporant anymore.
