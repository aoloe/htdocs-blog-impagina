In the [latest Azione](http://epaper.azione.ch/ee/azion/_main_/2013/02/11/039/) we can read about the Paola Dubini's book on the [transformations in the books and in the publishing industry](http://www.inmondadori.it/Voltare-pagina-Paola-Dubini/eai978887192659/) and her thoughts about the characteristics that make the book on paper so valuable:

- The linear way of reading is still the preferred one.
- The reader is accepting the choices made by the author or the person having organized the contents.
- Le physical properties of paper (as an example for illustrated books)
- The possibility to publish with high aesthetic standards or historical-philological value.
- The chance to give a value to its conservation.




Stefano Vassere – the author of the Azione' article – adds a few more qualities one can attach to the books:

- the symbolic-affective value,
- the tactile-perceptive sensation,
- the chance to give them away,
- the "consumption" traces,
- and the traditional places where they are distributed and preserved.
