Looking at the Scribus users base, I see three main typologies:

- editors self-publishing their works,
- graphic designers collecting texts from commissioners, giving it a readable form, and putting a nice skin around it,
- _publishers_ collecting content from writers and looking for a more or less standard output.

Those targets have different needs and it's not an easy task to please of all of them.

In the next few months I'll try to have a closer closer to the ways their habits and requirements are evolving and how we can build software that they will use and love.

> One first thought: we don't have to target all kinds of users. Even inside the typologies listed above – which are probably not comprehensive –. As an example, we don't have to please all the editors, but we may want to create software for a specific kind of editors.

Let's start from the first type of users: the editors that want to take the whole workflow in their hands.

As a first appetizer two blog articles by two geeky authors who have recently written about publishing a tech book:

- [Self-publishing a book](http://blog.filipekberg.se/2012/08/27/self-publishing-a-book-part-1-where-it-all-began/) by Filip Ekberg, who wrote a [book on C#](http://www.amazon.com/C-Smorgasbord-Filip-Ekberg/dp/1468152106/).
- [Writing is hard, so do it](http://kyan.com/blog/2013/1/29/writing-is-hard-so-do-it) by Neil Middleton who is currently writing a book about Heroku.

The most interesting parts: both choose to go for tools that allow them to focus on the task of writing, and are directly typing some markup to generate the target output.

The first one went with [TeXnicCenter](http://www.texniccenter.org/), an editor that helps writing LaTeX tags. The second one with IAwriter, an OS X text editor with spelling checking, Mardkown preview and remote storage on Dropbox. He is formatting his text with [Asciidoc](http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/).
