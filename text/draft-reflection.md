in the same way as the new scripter works in scribus, it should be possible to create any application that can be interfaced with python, lua or other things.

so scribus could be rewritten with:
- a real code api that talks to the external code (which function are stable and "allowed" to be called?
- the code around the rendering core is all written in any language, the language that fits.
- somehow, even saving the styles to disc could be "outsourced"...
