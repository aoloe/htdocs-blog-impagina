The big question is: how to correctly revision an .odt file? a .sla file? any complex file, containing different types of data (images, ...).
And how to correctly revision formatting? There is an example using markdown. But how to go further?

Still, one question is if the future of typography needs the typographical and content complexity that Scribus provides.
