one of the problems are to get people to like the programming language you've chosen... and my experience with scribus is that people tend not to like c++.

on a previous post, we saw that c++ is still one of the languages that are most searched for... but there seem to be a difference between the number of people who google it, and the people who would love to program with it in their free time!

Yesterday, I 've been reading [Google Go: The Good, the Bad, and the Meh](http://blog.carlsensei.com/post/42828735125) and, yes, I could conceive that Go – Also known as Golang – could be the right language to create the core of for a publishing engine:

- simple concurrency,
- clean language,
- utf8 support,
- list and hashes,
- much hyped and backed by Google...

On the other side, nobody has done something like this yet, so it will be hard to build open the shoulders of giants...
