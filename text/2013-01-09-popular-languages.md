One thing that bothers me: why is it so hard to find people programming in C++?<br />
The questions is related to the hard time we have in finding new contributors for Scribus. But it seems that many other projects are facing the same fate.

Looking a bit around, it was somehow clear to me that C++ is not a popular language, nothing somebody would volunteer to spend his evenings and weekends coding with...<br />
I mean: Rails, Scala, Python: those are the languages people like, the languages everybody is talking about.<br />
Java, C#: those are the languages people use at work.

But if I have a look at the linked image – published by the IEEE [1] – and to some other popularity statistics I could find [2], the problem should not be in the raw number of people with C++ skills.<br />
C++ seems even to be a popular language for job seeking: By far the number one, among the languages that can be considered for programming a multiplatform application!

On the other hand, there is one more chart that I would be curious to see: the number of slots in the three latest GSOC, sorted by programming language, country where the students lives and by type of project (server, game, OS, desktop application ...)<br />
Does anybody know if the numbers are available?<br />
It could be a good indicator for the popularity of each language: students that are "volunteering" to spend their summer coding for a project and wanting to improve skills that they hope will be useful when looking for a job...

Another related question I'd like to investigate: who is the typical contributor to a free software project?<br />
It's still the student with too much time at hand and looking for skills that will be useful when looking for a job?<br />
Or is it rather a young men who is a under-challenged at his daily workplace and is looking for adventure, maybe on the way to become a freelancer?<br />
And are there other potential groups of candidates? Who are they?<br />
Are there any artisans wanting to shape their tools?
