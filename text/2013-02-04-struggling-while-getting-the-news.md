1. Go to website.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
2. Be told you aren’t allowed to read the website.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
3. Be redirected to an App Store.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
4. Download the app.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
5. Wait while a multi-megabyte file downloads over your temperamental, expensive 3G connection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
6. Open the app up.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
7. Familiarise yourself with an interface that has cryptic, weird touch affordances that aren’t actually revealed to the user and behave ever so slightly differently from every other similar app.                                                                                                                       
8. Struggle as the badly-implemented statefulness gives you a spinning loading wheel (on iOS) or flashing progress bar (on Android) because you had the audacity to use your mobile device on a slow or unreliable connection.                                                                                            
9. Attempt to find the story you wanted to read using a layout and information architecture that’s completely different from the layout and information architecture of the website that you’ve grown familiar with, because some arsehole decided that the process of reading the electronic equivalent of a             
newspaper needs to be “disrupted” because he’s been reading far too much Seth Godin or some other bullshit.                                                                                                                                                                                                            
10. Realise that the app shows you different things depending on whether it’s in landscape or portrait mode. Now you can look like an utter nob on the Tube rotating your iPad around so that you can zoom further into the Page 3 stunna’s tits.                                                                          
11. Not be able to share the story with your friends because it’s not a page on the web with a Uniform Resource Indicator. Because why do you need Uniform Resource Indicators when you’ve got shiny smooth buttons on a phone?                                                                                            
12. Take time to download updated binary files the next time the application is updated in the App Store, that’ll provide you “new functionality”, even though there is no fucking functionality you actually want other than reading the fucking news.                                                                    
13. If you are on Android, be sure to install some anti-adware software in case the app comes with some delightful bit of creepy privacy-intruding out-of-app advertising.                                                                                                                                                 
14. Give up, go to newsagent, buy paper edition, throw smartphone off a fucking cliff and start a letterbomb campaign against all the idiots who thought that turning newspapers into “apps” was a good idea.

while it looks interesting to package your news into an app, this needs much further thoughts before it can be deployed on large scale!

at then end, somebody will be providing a "standard" app (well, several companies will provide multiple _standard_ but incompatible apps) to package the news.

so, what we would need:
- a way to make a pseudo app out of o a website
- a standard way to describe a website – embedded in the website itself – so that a psudo good app can be made out of it.

if possible, with caching capabilities...
